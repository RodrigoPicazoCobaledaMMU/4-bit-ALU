# 4 Bit ALU - Verilog

This project implements a 4 bit ALU in Verilog which can perform adding,multiplying,modulo division and bitwise and. While this project is very basic and I intend to make further more interesting projects this taught me how to design and simulate verilog code using an industry grade IDE,AMD Vivado, aswell as using waveforms and schematics to visualise my logic ; something that was out of the scope for my computer architecture course.

## Dependencies

- AMD Vivado 2025.1 - I used the free standard edition.

## How to install

You can install and run the program by cloning into it and running the .xpr file.
